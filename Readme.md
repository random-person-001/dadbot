# Dadbot
## Discord bot for when you miss your own dad

Dadbot makes dad jokes. Dadbot makes obnoxious snarky comments. Dadbot is not a good addition to a serious or productive server.  Thus, Dadbot has proved immensely popular.

### Wait but what actually is it?

Uh just a discord bot written in discord.py to keep you from being too productive.

### Why isn't there a useful help command?

Did your dad ever give you a handy guide to all you need to know?  Nope.  Neither does Dadbot.

### I miss my daddy, how do I make this empty replacement come alive to fill a hole in my soul that money and objects and discord bots really can't fill regardless of how hard I try?

Download python 3.7 or 3.8 and make sure you have pipenv and then you should be able to run it fine.  You'll need a bot token and stuff from discord. And probably a kleenex for your tears (not included).

Alternatively if you don't want to self host it, [this link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=541765455111782405&scope=bot&permissions=51200) probably works.

### Who's Dadbot's dad? I want to know my grandpa

Ok uh that's just weird.  Imma stop you there
